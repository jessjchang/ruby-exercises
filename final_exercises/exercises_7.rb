array = [1, 2, 3]
# array is an ordered list of elements, which can be accessed by index
# to access the element 1 in this array, we would reference the index with array[0]

hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
# hash contains key-value pairs, so we can access values by referencing the key
# to access the value 1 in this hash, we would reference the key with hash[:one]
